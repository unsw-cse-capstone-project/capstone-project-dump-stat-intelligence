Week 1

Posted on the tute forum as instructed. Nominated Sam as Scrum Master and had her reach out to Zach and Tom, completing our group.
Following group formationcommunication channels were set up and a short meeting was held from 4-4:30 on Thursday, mainly introductions
and broad project details (e.g. software for frontend/backend, preferred project). A second meeting was held on Friday morning from
9-11:45, mostly during our scheduled lab time. After a brief presentation from Maryam about what she expected from us we split off into
groups. Our scrum master emailed Maryam all our group details and we set to work creating our Jira and Github organisations. We then
discussed what epic stories were required to satisfy the provided project objectives, and then populated these epics with the appropriate
user stories determined during our discussion. We also discussed potential novel features we could create outside of the project scope,
such as highlighting ingredients which are expiring soon (based on a user entered expiry date) or creating a "pantry", allowing you to
quickly select from ingredients you have on hand rather than having to re-enter them with every search. Finally, we organised our next 
meeting for Monday 1-2. Before then we would review and refine our user story backlog, research existing websites and work on the external
actor descriptions. In the meeting we plan to consider the underlying system architecture, design some storyboards and work towards a draft
project proposal.
