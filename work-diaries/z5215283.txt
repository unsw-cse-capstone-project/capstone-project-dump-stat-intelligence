Week 1
Our group was formed. Had a meeting on Thursday to align our understanding of our intentions and our goals. Chose our project, MealMatch. Set up Jira and the git repository for the project. As a whole group, worked through and created the epics and user stories on Jira, as well as discussed which additional functionality we inteded to add. 
Looking ahead we planned our next meeting for early week 2, and decided to individually go over the user stories, look at some websites similar to the project and have a think about the different frameworks we might want to use.

Week 2
We started working through our proposal properly. Tom and I were working mainly on the system architecture. This included thinking about user interactions and what the interaction between the frontend and backend might look like. Also discussed what the database might look like (specifically in regard to ER diagram). Met on Monday and Friday to check in and work through proposal.

Week 3
The main objective for week 3 was to complete the proposal. I finalised the information in the system architecture. We also worked towards getting ready to start coding. In this regard, I set up the backend framework with django. We had a big meeting on friday, where we went over the proposal one more time. After discussion, we worked through the API between frontend and backend and I remade the ER diagram based on our revised version.

Week 4
For the start of wk4, Tom and I worked through our own idea of what the site would look like individually. We then met on Tuesday and created a combined vision. Between then and Friday, I worked on getting the navbar and icons set up. Over the weekend I worked on finishing the nav and starting to get the settings and logins modals/pages up and running.
