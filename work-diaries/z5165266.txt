Week 1

Formed a group before the week 1 lab. I created a Jira account and 
linked it to the project, as well as linking my pre-existing GitHub 
account to the project GitHub. Discussing with the team we defined the 
scope of the project and wrote up the user epics and user stories on 
Jira.

Week 2

Team met again on Monday. We discussed user stories defined previously, 
refining and adding a few. We also began the project proposal and 
distributed work between the team members. On a high level project 
structure was decided. I was assigned to flow diagrams in the technical 
section of the proposal along with my team member Samantha.

Week 3

Quiet week as we prepare for the start of the actual project having done 
most of the work on the proposal as a group already. I began looking at 
Django which I will be working with significantly during the project. We 
also met on Friday during the lab in which we finalised the project and 
distributed work with the intention of completing the first sprint.
