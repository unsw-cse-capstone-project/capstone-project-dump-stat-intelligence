Week 1

Formed a group before the week 1 lab. I created a Jira account and 
linked it to the project, as well as linking my pre-existing GitHub 
account to the project GitHub. Discussing with the team we defined the 
scope of the project and wrote up the user epics and user stories on 
Jira.

Week 2

Team met again on Monday. We discussed user stories defined previously, 
refining and adding a few. We also began the project proposal and 
distributed work between the team members. On a high level project 
structure was decided. I was assigned to flow diagrams in the technical 
section of the proposal along with my team member Samantha.
