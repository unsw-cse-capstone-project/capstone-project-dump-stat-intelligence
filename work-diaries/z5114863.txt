Sam's work diary - COMP3900 'MealMatch' Project

Week 1:

Formed our group. I volunteered to be the Scrum Master, so made the group on WebCMS and added members. Had a brief meeting on Thursday
afternoon. After the meeting, I set up the group Jira and GitHub pages.
During our lab slot on Friday morning, we added the user stories Rohan had drafted to Jira, added a few that were missing and made
sure they fit the Connextra format. We decided over the weekend to further refine the user stories and also do some background research
into existing websites.

Week 2:

Had a meeting on Monday where we discussed some high level functionality of our site. We went through what would be required for the
project proposal, and split up the tasks amongst the group. Before Friday, I am going to make the storyboard diagrams with Rohan's help.
We aim to each have drafted our parts for the proposal by Friday so that we can review them as a group during our lab.
