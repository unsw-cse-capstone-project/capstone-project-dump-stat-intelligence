MEETING LOG

Thursday 4/6, 4pm - 4:30pm
Initial meeting to meet other group members and agree on project. Discussed which frameworks we would consider using, and how we would
work as a team to complete this project - we agreed on mostly individual work (once user stories are assigned) and one or two weekly
meetings to check in on progress.

Friday 5/6, 9am - 11:45am
Met up during our lab slot. Added user stories to Jira under epic categories. Discussed features we plan on implementing - basic ones
required by spec, extensions, and further extensions that may be added if time permits. Before next meeting - review user stories, do
background research.

Monday 8/6, 1pm - 2pm
Discussed results of research over weekend. Discussed system architecture. Split up tasks for project proposal as follows:
  - background and user stories: Michael
  - interface and flow diagrams: Sam and Rohan
  - system architecture diagrams: Zach and Tom
Before next meeting (on Friday, lab slot) - finish drafts of above tasks so they can be reviewed by the group. Email tutor about some
questions we have about the proposal - specifically, whether further diagrams are needed, and whether we need any more info before we 
can start coding.
