# Pantry Pirate
COMP3900 Group Project - Dump Stat Intelligence

## Running Requirements / User Guide

To run the project, ensure most recent version of:

- nodejs is installed: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
- python3 https://www.python.org/downloads/
- yarn package manager: https://yarnpkg.com/
- pipenv package manager: https://pipenv-fork.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

are all installed.

To install required packages for backend:
  - create a new python3 virtual environment with `pipenv --three` when in the root directory of the project
  - Run `pipenv install` in the root directory to install all required packages

To install required packages for the frontend:
  - cd into `/frontend`
  - run `yarn install` (note if you get to a message that says the installer is "locking" and doesn't end you can control-c and continue)

To run the project:
  - ensure no other processes are running on ports 3000, 8000
  - open 2 terminal windows in the root directory of the project
  - run `make frontend` in one window
  - in the other window run `pipenv shell` to use the pipenv environment
  - run `make backend` in the other window
  - visit `http://localhost:3000` and use the project


## Getting Started

### Using Make

Ensure you have concurrently installed (`yarn global add concurrently`) and are in the python virtual environment for backend (`pipenv shell` in `/backend/pantrypirate`). You can use these commands to run the project:

- `make backend`: run the backend on port 8000
- `make frontend`: run the frontend on port 3000
- `make all`: simultaneously make frontend and backend

### Frontend

See [The API Spec](API_SPEC.md) for details on what the frontend expects

#### Running the project**

- Ensure nodejs and yarn are installed
- Install required packages: `yarn install`

Dev server (hot reloading): `yarn run dev`

Build for production: `yarn run build`



#### Frontend File Structure
```
/components
/lib
  /api
  /redux
  /utils
/pages
/public
/styles
```

- `/components` contains shared React components used in various routes
- `/lib` library of helper scripts
  - `/api` scripts associated with making calls to and from the backend
  - `/redux` files associated with the state management of the site, including the redux actions and reducers
  - `/utils` remaining helper scripts, mainly are localstate management
- `/pages` contains views for routes. Routes for the frontend are created based on the file structure underneath this folder (https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/introduction)
- `/styles` contains **GLOBAL** styles. For most Sass work you should create a module for each component in the same directory as the component. I.e. create `components/Button.js` and then also create `components/Button.module.scss` and import the scss file in the component.

#### Backend File Structure
```
/pantrypirate
    db.sqlite3

    - `serializers.py` contains REST serializers for interaction between
     frontend and database
